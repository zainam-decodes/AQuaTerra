## 🚀 Project Overview  
Plastic and waste pollution is one of the biggest challenges threatening both **marine** and **terrestrial** life.  
This project provides:  
- 📸 **Image-based detection** of trash in diverse environments (rivers, oceans, lakes, streets, and open land).  
- 🤖 **AI models** trained on the **AquaTrash dataset** for multi-class classification.  
- 🌍 A tool that contributes towards **sustainable development goals (SDGs)**:  
  - **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**  
  - **SDG 14: Life Below Water**  
  - **SDG 15: Life on Land**
